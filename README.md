# Aggregate Functions Practice

## Important Resources
- [JDBC-AggregateFunctions Lab](https://github.com/Revature-NG-Java-Content/W2D3-sql-JDBC-aggregate-functions-activity/blob/main/AggregateFunctionsJDBCLab.md)

## Time
- 2 hours

### Description
It is important that associates practice SQL querying using Java. As we work our way towards being abstracted away from writing SQL queries when building our projects, it is important to understand how exactly our Java projects are able to communicate with our database . 

### Main Goals
- Practice writing SQL queries with aggregate functions in JDBC
- Associates expand their knowledge of what type of queries are possible in SQL and how to execute those queries using Java

## Trainer Instructions
1. Go over your lesson on JDBC.
2. Give them the link to the aggregate functions guided practice lab. 
3. After 2 hours see if anyone has completed the lab. 
 Note: It's up to you to decide if associates will push their projects to github as part of their todos.
4. Encourage associates that aren't finished after 2hrs to pair with associates that have completed the activity



## Associate Instructions
1. Open the JDBC-Aggregate-Funtions lab.
2. Complete the lab.
3. Take notes on what is clear and what is foggy.
4. Once you've completed the lab and written down questions you'd like to ask, pair up with your fellow associates to share ideas/solutions.

### Important Notes
Read through the lab one full time before jumping into it and of course Have Fun!
