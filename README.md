# Aggregate Functions Practice

## Important Resources
- [JDBC-AggregateFunctions Lab](https://github.com/Revature-NG-Java-Content/W2D3-sql-JDBC-aggregate-functions-activity/blob/main/AggregateFunctionsJDBCLab.md)

## Time
- 2 hours

### Description
It is important that associates practice SQL querying using Java. As we work our way towards being abstracted away from writing SQL queries when building our projects, it is important to understand how exactly our Java projects are able to communicate with our database . 

### Main Goals
- Practice writing SQL queries with aggregate functions in JDBC
- Associates expand their knowledge of what type of queries are possible in SQL and how to execute those queries using Java

## Trainer Instructions
1. Go over your lesson on querying and SQL
2. Give them the link to the aggregate funcitions guided practice lab.
3. After 2 hours see if who has uploaded questions and get their links
4. Share these links with the other associates


## Associate Instructions
1. Open the JDBC-Aggregate-Funtions lab.
2. Complete the lab.
3. Take notes on what is clear and what foggy.
4. Once you've completed the lab and written down questions you'd like to ask pair up with your fellow associates to share ideas/solutions.

### Important Notes
Read through the lab one full time before jumping into it and of course Have Fun!
