# Aggregate Functions Practice

## Important Resources
- [JDBC-AggregateFunctions Lab](https://github.com/Revature-NG-Java-Content/W2D3-sql-JDBC-aggregate-functions-activity/blob/main/AggregateFunctionsJDBCLab.md)

## Time
- 2 hours

### Description
It is important that associates practice SQL querying. Creating DAOs will not give them the exposure needed to write the queries expected in interview questions. The Chinook database is an example database ready for querying. Associates will solve the query challenges provided. Once they finsh with those challenges they should create 5 sql Questions of their own. Encourage associates to come up with queries that expand their knowledge. Use things like pattern matching, order by descending or lesser used set operators.

### Main Goals
- Practice writing SQL queries with aggregate functions in JDBC
- Associates expand their knowledge of what type of queries are possible in SQL and how to execute those queries using Java

## Trainer Instructions
1. Go over your lesson on querying and SQL
2. Give them the link to the aggregate funcitions guided practice lab.
3. After 2 hours see if who has uploaded questions and get their links
4. Share these links with the other associates


## Associate Instructions
1. Open the JDBC-Aggregate-Funtions lab.
2. Complete the lab.
3. Take notes on what is clear and what foggy.
4. Once you've completed the lab and written down questions you'd like to ask pair up with your fellow associates to share ideas/solutions.

### Important Notes
Read through the lab one full time before jumping into it and ofcourse Have Fun!
